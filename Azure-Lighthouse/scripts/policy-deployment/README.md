# Azure Policy Deployment Scripts

This folder contains the scripts to deploy Azure Policy into a 'Customer' Subscription.

[ **Note:** Before running these scripts make sure that you have running them under the context of the MSPTenant subscription. Use `Connect-AzAccount` to switch if required ]  
  
The scripts query [Azure Resource Graph](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/resource-graph/) to identify resources that will be targets for Azure Policy.
  
The `$MSPTenant` variable in the scripts need to be updated with the _Tenant Id_ value returned by the `Get-AzTenant` cmdlet.
  
*Example Scripts*
  
1. Query Storage Accounts for the Secure Transfer setting
2. Deploy an Audit Policy for Storage Accounts where the Secure Transfer setting is disabled 
Below are a couple of screenshots showing the Compliance of the deployed Azure Policy templates and a filtered view based on the Category that was assigned via the ARM Template

3. Deploy a Deny Policy to prevent Storage Accounts being created with the Secure Transfer setting disabled  
Once the Deny policy has been deployed, try to create a new Storage Account but disable the Secure Transfer option  
When the user tries to create the Storage Account, the policy will prevent the creation of the storage account as shown below:
